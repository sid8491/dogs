                  best potential puppies. The final dogs that we deem ready to
                  come to your home are both a loving, playful pet and a
                  fearsome defender of your family's lives. A stable well
                  balanced canine is what we strive for.

                    growl towards any threat, person or animal, on and off
                    leash. The dog will be at your left side whilst continuing
                    to guard you, until released.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Vorhaus/Hold and bark: Upon command, the dog will sprint to
                    the criminal/threat and aggressively jump and bark. The dog

                  <li>
                    Guard the door: Upon command the dog will sprint to the exit
                    you direct him to and he will prevent anyone from leaving.
                    Attack: Upon command or upon physical assault, your dog is
                    trained to attack the threat or intruder. If the suspect has
                    a weapon, he will attack the hand holding the weapon. If you
                    are being attacked by more than one person, the dog will
                    always go after the person directly assaulting you and
                    switch aggressors if necessary. Hold: If the dog is biting
                    and you do not want him to let go of the aggressor you can
                    reinforce the bite by saying hold
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Aus: If you want the dog to stop the attack on a suspect

                    Search: This command when you want the dog to search your
                    home or estate/land before you enter. If the dog finds an
                    intruder, he will detain the intruder with a hold and bark.
                    If the intruder tries to escape, the dog will attack. The
                    dog distinguishes friend or foe by scent not sight thus
                    preventing friendly attacks.

                  <li>
                    Protect Premises: When the dog is in his home and if a
                    stranger approaches he will begin barking to warn the
                    suspect and to alert you of the threat. If the intruder
                    enters the house, the dog will attack.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Protect Vehicle: If the dog is in your car and someone tries
                    to pull you out of the car, the dog will attack the
                    criminal. If a stranger enters the parked car, the dog will
                    attack.
